Repository contains several d3 based standard graphics. Each of the graphics are designed with many public functions to make interactive charting easier.  Each of a graphic's set of functions may be chained.

The graphics include:

| Function       | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| app_bar        | A bar chart with possible multiple variables                 |
| app_heatmap    | A heatmap with several scales to chose from                  |
| app_histo      | A histogram with control for bin size                        |
| app_scatter    | A point scatter chart with possible multiple variables       |
| app_table      | A svg based graphics table  with arguments for multiple column widths and colors. |
